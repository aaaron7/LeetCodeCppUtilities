# LeetCodeCppUtilities
Few ugly but useful C++ code snippet for Leetcode practice, makes you focus on problem solving, forget other dirty works.



## For who
- practice on OJ, like Leetcode.
- can't stand to boring structure declaration.(e.g. LinkedList,Binary Tree or string based big number operation)
- too lazy to write test case for complex structure.
 
## Contains
 
 - String based big number operation: `add`, `multiply` and special `add` for binary decimal.
 - Linked List utility: `Node declaration`, `print`, `create`, and `linked list based big number add`.
 - File operation: a simple parser which can parse most commonly used test case format in Leetcode. `["aaaaaaa",ccccccc"...]`
 - Common `binary search` template.
 - Binary Tree: `print`, `create`, `array based create`, `level print`. 
 
## TODO:
 
 - Origanize project files better.
 - More handy IO interface.
 - Dynamic Programming template.
 - BFS/DFS template.
